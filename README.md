[![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/splitsoftware.svg?style=social&label=Follow&maxAge=1529000)](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=splitsoftware)

## Overview
This Provider is designed to allow the use of OpenFeature with Split, the platform for controlled rollouts, serving features to your users via the Split feature flag to manage your complete customer experience.

## Compatibility
This SDK is compatible with Java 11 and higher.

## Getting started
Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation of the Split Provider. Please see the [OpenFeature Documentation](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-api) for details on how to use the OpenFeature SDK.

```java
import dev.openfeature.javasdk.OpenFeatureAPI;
import io.split.openfeature.SplitProvider

OpenFeatureAPI api = OpenFeatureAPI.getInstance();
api.setProvider(new SplitProvider("YOUR_API_KEY"));
```

If you are more familiar with Split or want access to other initialization options, you can provide a `SplitClient` to the constructor. See the [Split Java SDK Documentation](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020405151-Java-SDK) for more information.
```java
import dev.openfeature.javasdk.OpenFeatureAPI;
import io.split.openfeature.SplitProvider
import io.split.client.SplitClient;
import io.split.client.SplitClientConfig;
import io.split.client.SplitFactoryBuilder;

OpenFeatureAPI api = OpenFeatureAPI.getInstance();


SplitClientConfig config = SplitClientConfig.builder()
   .setBlockUntilReadyTimeout(10000)
   .build();
SplitClient splitClient = SplitFactoryBuilder.build("YOUR_API_KEY", config).client();
api.setProvider(new SplitProvider(splitClient));
```

## Use of OpenFeature with Split
After the initial setup you can use OpenFeature according to their [documentation](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-api/).

One important note is that the Split Provider **requires a targeting key** to be set. Often times this should be set when evaluating the value of a flag by [setting an EvaluationContext](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context) which contains the targeting key. An example flag evaluation is
```java
Client client = api.getClient("CLIENT_NAME");

EvaluationContext context = new EvaluationContext("TARGETING_KEY");
Boolean boolValue = client.getBooleanValue("boolFlag", false, context);
```
If the same targeting key is used repeatedly, the evaluation context may be set at the client level 
```java
EvaluationContext context = new EvaluationContext("TARGETING_KEY");
client.setEvaluationContext(context)
```
or at the OpenFeatureAPI level 
```java
EvaluationContext context = new EvaluationContext("TARGETING_KEY");
OpenFeatureAPI.getInstance().setCtx(context)
````
If the context was set at the client or api level, it is not required to provide it during flag evaluation.
